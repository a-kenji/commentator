Commentator is a fucking fast source code comments finder CLI and Rust SDK (crate).

**work in progress.**

TODO: badges

# Motivation

Existing source code comments extractors (see References) forcomments extracting are quite slow,
not always accurate (don't find all comments) or doesn't provide
SDK. This tool fixes all of this.

# Usage

This library could be used as CLI or from code.

## CLI usage

./commentator filename.java

## SDK usage
